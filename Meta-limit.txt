## ADD: X-Robots-Tag HTTP header:
DeviantArt covers how to set the X-Robots-Tag header (which also has other uses to help control how search engines crawl your site) to express an opt-out.
On Apache httpd (I know, I’m old school) it’s something like this:


Header Set X-Robots-Tag "noai"

#  X tags:
X-Robots-Tag: noai

X-Robots-Tag: noimageai

X-Robots-Tag: noml

X-Robots-Tag: nofollow, noml

tdm-reservation: 1

OR:

Header set X-Robots-Tag "noai, noimageai"
Header set tdm-reservation "1"

## privacy opt out for servers ****
This is the first site to include the new SPC meta tag and X-Robots-Tag header 
for a privacy opt-out that works like Global Privacy Control but for servers. 
Basically you have legally enforceable rights in your personal information, blogs have personal information, 
but regular GPC only works from your browser (client) to company on the server. This goes the other way, and sends a legally enforceable* 
*yes, I know, this has not yet been tested in court, but give it a minute, we’re just getting started hereprivacy signal from a personal blog on the server 
to an AI scraper on the client side.

So the new header on here is

X-Robots-Tag: noai, noimageai, SPC

#IN .htaccess put: Then they only can get one visit/per IP! Works great, have it on my blogs:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
MaxConnPerIP 1
</IfModule>

# Another way:
MaxClients < number-of-connections> 

## I use this on .htaccess 1 - my own:)

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/images/
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [E=RATE_LIMIT:1]
Header set Retry-After "77550" env=RATE_LIMIT</IfModule>
<IfModule ratelimit_module>
SetOutputFilter RATE_LIMIT
SetEnv rate-limit 100
SetEnv rate-initial-burst 200

</IfModule>
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/Post/
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ - [E=RATE_LIMIT:1]
Header set Retry-After "5" env=RATE_LIMIT</ifModule>
