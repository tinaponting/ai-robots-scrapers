3 Steps to create Magento 2 Robots.txt:

2. Navigate to Content > Design > Configuration
1_Global edit
3. Expand the Search Engine Robots.

set Meta Robots from Magento admin panel
Save the Configuration
The robots exclusion protocol or standard, also known as Robots.txt can be configured in default Magento 2 with the above steps.

Why Should I Set NoIndex NoFollow Tags to Links in Magento 2:
For example, you are launching a new product in your Magento 2 store. However, your team is still working on it. For time being, you can set that product page to NoIndex to tell the search engine to not index that page.

In this way, you can test the changes in the live store and at the same time restrict the search engine to index it.

Also, the NoFollow tags to links can be useful when you want to offer any additional information that is located on a particular web address but not pass the link equity.

Meta robots tags: NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW
Now that you have created robots.txt successfully, pay attention to the meta robots tags. Cover the unnecessary parts of the code from crawlers using these tags.

No Index is an attribute of tag, that restricts the transfer of the page weight to a non certified source. Moreover, it can be used for pages with a large number of external links.
No Follow hides the page from indexation
Apply Nofollow or Noindex to your configuration by either updating the robots.txt file or using meta name=“robots” tag.

Possible Combinations:

INDEX, FOLLOW: Instructs the web crawlers to index the store and check back later for the changes.
NOINDEX, FOLLOW: Instructs the web crawlers not to index the store but check back later.
INDEX, NOFOLLOW: Instructs the web crawlers to index the site once and avoid checking back later.
NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW: Instructs the web crawlers not to index the site and also not check back later
Add the following code to the robots.txt file in order to hide specific pages:

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

User-agent: *
Disallow: /myfile.html
Alternatively, you can restrict indexation with the following code:

<html >
<head >
<meta name=”robots” content=”noindex, follow”/ >
<title>page title>
</head >
The recommended default settings for Magento 2:
User-agent: *
